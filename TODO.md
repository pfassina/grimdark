# List of to dos:

- The movement range overlay will ignore the icon tiles beneath it, and render as if it were a plains
- When choosing to Wait and the unit hasn't performed an action other than moving, it should ask the player for confirmation that they want to wait that unit's turn
- When moving the cursor during the movement or attack range, the cursor movement should be limited to the movement/attack range area.
- We should improve the display of the inspect mode (shorcut "V"). This should free up the cursor, and allow the user to inspect any tile in the map. When in inspect mode and pressing enter on top of a tile, it should open an inspect panel that provides detailed information about the map tile (terrain, movement cost, X, Y positions) and any unit on top of it (Name, Class, HP, Available Actions, Queue position in the timeline, and any other status we have about the unit).
