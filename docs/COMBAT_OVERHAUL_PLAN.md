# Combat Overhaul: The Grinding Wheel System
## Design Document & Implementation Tracking

---

## üéØ Project Goals

### Core Vision
Transform the current phase-based combat system into a **grimdark, fluid timeline-based system** that emphasizes:
- **Tactical depth through time management** - Every action has temporal consequences
- **Imperfect information and uncertainty** - Hidden intents create tension
- **Persistent consequences** - Battles leave permanent scars
- **Environmental chaos** - The battlefield itself is dangerous
- **No perfect victories** - Success means survival, not domination

### Key Departures from Current System
| Current System | Target System |
|---------------|--------------|
| Player phase ‚Üí Enemy phase | Fluid timeline with mixed unit turns |
| Binary has_moved/has_acted flags | Action weights determine next turn timing |
| Perfect information about enemy actions | Hidden intents with partial reveals |
| Full HP restoration between battles | Persistent wounds and scarring |
| Static battlefields | Dynamic hazards and escalation |
| Hit/miss RNG | Guaranteed hits with damage variance |

## üèóÔ∏è Subsystems Requiring Design & Implementation

### 1. Timeline Management System
**Status:** üü¢ Complete  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Components:**
- [x] Timeline queue data structure (`src/core/timeline.py`)
- [x] Timeline entry management (add, remove, reorder)
- [x] Time tick processing logic
- [x] Turn order calculation algorithm
- [x] Timeline state serialization

**Implementation Overview:**
- **Priority Queue Architecture**: Built using Python's `heapq` module for O(log n) insertion/removal performance
- **Discrete Tick System**: Uses integer time values (not floating point) for deterministic, reproducible behavior
- **Lazy Deletion System**: Marks removed entries rather than rebuilding heap, trading memory for performance
- **Sequence ID Ordering**: Ensures deterministic resolution when multiple units act simultaneously
- **Timeline Formula**: `next_time = current_time + base_speed + action_weight`

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ‚úÖ **Discrete vs Continuous Time**: Chose discrete integer ticks for deterministic behavior and easier debugging
- ‚úÖ **Simultaneous Actions**: Use sequence IDs for stable sorting when execution times are equal
- ‚úÖ **Timeline Lookahead**: Limited to 10 entries to prevent UI performance issues
- ‚úÖ **Timeline Manipulation**: Foundation exists through direct timeline entry modification

**Design Questions:**
- How do we handle simultaneous actions? ‚úÖ *Resolved: Sequence IDs*
- Should timeline be discrete ticks or continuous time? ‚úÖ *Resolved: Discrete ticks*
- How far ahead should the timeline predict? ‚úÖ *Resolved: 10 entry limit*

5. **Morale Architecture**: ‚úÖ *Individual unit morale with proximity modifiers for social effects*
6. **Panic Recovery**: ‚úÖ *Multi-threshold system with rally mechanics and leadership bonuses*
7. **Escalation Philosophy**: ‚úÖ *Hybrid predictable/surprise system with player influence on threat level*
8. **Time Pressure Implementation**: ‚úÖ *Multiple escalation types create mounting pressure without hard timers*

### Critical Decisions Still Needed
1. **UI Display Priority**: How to show all combat information without overwhelming the player
2. **Save Compatibility**: Best approach for preserving existing save files

### Risk Factors
1. **Complexity Creep**: System may become too complex for players to understand
2. **Performance**: Timeline with many units/interrupts could be slow
3. **Balance**: Action weights will need extensive tuning
4. **Save Compatibility**: May break existing save files
5. **UI Clarity**: Showing all information without overwhelming player

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Rollout**: Test each phase thoroughly before moving on
2. **Performance Budgets**: Set limits on timeline lookahead and interrupt chains
3. **Playtesting**: Regular testing with focus groups
4. **Migration Tools**: Provide save file converters if needed
5. **UI Iterations**: Multiple UI prototypes before final implementation

## üìù Notes & Ideas

### Inspiration Sources
- **XCOM**: Overwatch/interrupt system
- **Divinity Original Sin**: Environmental interactions
- **Battle Brothers**: Permanent injuries
- **Darkest Dungeon**: Stress/morale system
- **Into the Breach**: Perfect information vs. hidden information balance

### Future Expansions (Post-Launch)
- **Stance System**: Defensive/aggressive/balanced affecting action weights
- **Combo Actions**: Multi-unit coordinated attacks
- **Timeline Manipulation**: Abilities that alter turn order
- **Environmental Blessings/Curses**: Map-wide effects
- **Veterancy System**: Units gain quirks/traits from surviving battles

### Technical Considerations
- Consider using a priority queue for timeline efficiency ‚úÖ *Implemented*
- May need to implement event sourcing for replay system
- Could use observer pattern for interrupt triggers ‚úÖ *Implemented*
- Timeline visualization might benefit from animation system ‚úÖ *Implemented*
- Consider caching frequently calculated values (pathfinding with hazards)

### **Recent Accomplishments** (Latest Session)
**UI/UX Integration Complete** - All major interface enhancements finished:

1. **Wound Status Panel** ‚úÖ
   - Added comprehensive wound display to unit information panel
   - Shows wound count, detailed descriptions, and stat penalties
   - Color-coded severity indicators (red for wounds, normal for healthy)
   - Displays up to 3 wounds with "...and X more" for additional injuries

2. **Morale Indicators** ‚úÖ  
   - Unit psychological state display with current morale level (0-150)
   - Morale state visualization (Normal/Panicked/Routed/Heroic/Confident)
   - Color-coded morale states (red for poor, yellow for shaken, green for confident)
   - Active morale modifier tracking and display

3. **Timeline Visualization** ‚úÖ
   - Top-bar timeline showing upcoming unit turns and actions
   - Action weight display for strategic decision making
   - Hidden intent support ("???" for unknown AI actions)
   - Color-coded icons and status indicators (‚öî attack, üèÉ move, üõ° prepare)
   - Proper layout integration reserving screen space

4. **Damage Variance Display** ‚úÖ
   - Enhanced battle forecasts showing damage ranges (e.g., "6-10" instead of "8")
   - Separate min/max calculations for primary and counter attacks
   - Improved forecast popup with additional information
   - Better damage prediction accuracy for tactical planning

5. **Performance Validation** ‚úÖ
   - All 475 unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
   - Performance benchmarks completed - no regressions detected
   - Rendering performance excellent: ~1.7ms context building, ~152Œºs combat rendering
   - Large battle scenarios (100+ units) performing within acceptable limits
