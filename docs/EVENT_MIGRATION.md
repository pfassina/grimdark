# Event-Driven Architecture Migration Guide

## Why This Migration?

### The Problem: "Spaghettification"
The original manager system had become a complex web of cross-dependencies where managers directly imported and called each other:

```
TimelineManager ‚Üí LogManager, UIManager
CombatManager ‚Üí LogManager, MoraleManager, EscalationManager  
InputHandler ‚Üí CombatManager, UIManager, LogManager
MoraleManager ‚Üí LogManager, EscalationManager
EscalationManager ‚Üí LogManager, HazardManager, MoraleManager
```

This created several critical issues:
- **Circular Dependencies**: Managers importing each other created import cycles
- **Tight Coupling**: Changes to one manager broke multiple other managers
- **Testing Difficulty**: Unit testing required mocking numerous manager dependencies
- **Code Complexity**: Understanding data flow required tracing through multiple managers
- **Maintainability**: Adding features required touching multiple interconnected systems

### The Solution: Event-Driven Architecture
Replace all cross-dependencies with a centralized EventManager that coordinates communication:

```
All Managers ‚Üí EventManager ‚Üê All Managers
     ‚Üì                           ‚Üë
GameState (shared data)    Events (coordination)
```

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each manager handles exactly one domain
- **Loose Coupling**: Managers only know about EventManager and GameState
- **Easy Testing**: Managers can be unit tested in complete isolation
- **Clear Data Flow**: All communication is traceable through event emissions
- **Extensibility**: New managers can be added without touching existing code

## Major Design Decisions

### 1. **EventManager is Required, Not Optional**
**Decision**: EventManager must be a required constructor parameter for all managers
**Rationale**: 
- Eliminates "hybrid mode" where some features work without events
- Forces consistent architecture across all managers
- Makes event-driven communication the primary pattern
- Prevents accidental fallback to direct manager calls

### 2. **Pure Data Structures vs Decision-Making Managers**
**Decision**: Map and core data structures emit NO events; managers emit events after data operations
**Architecture**:
```python
# WRONG - Data structure emitting events
def move_unit(self, unit_id, position):
    # ... move logic ...
    self.event_manager.publish(UnitMoved(...))  # NO!

# RIGHT - Manager emits events  
def handle_movement(self, unit_id, position):
    if self.game_map.move_unit(unit_id, position):  # Pure data operation
        self.event_manager.publish(UnitMoved(...))  # Manager decision
```
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation between data storage and business logic
- Map can be tested without event dependencies
- Managers control when and why events are emitted
- Data structures remain simple and focused

### 3. **Immediate vs Queued Event Processing**
**Decision**: Support both immediate dispatch and queued processing
**Implementation**:
```python
# Immediate - for real-time coordination
event_manager.publish(UnitMoved(...))  

# Queued - for batch processing
event_manager.queue_event(TurnProcessed(...))
event_manager.process_queue()
```
**Rationale**:
- Immediate events for tight coordination (combat, UI updates)
- Queued events for turn-based processing and ordering control
- Prevents infinite event loops and stack overflow

### 4. **Rich Event Payloads with Context**
**Decision**: Events include full context, not just minimal data
**Example**:
```python
UnitMoved(
    turn=5,
    unit_name="Knight",
    unit_id="unit_123", 
    team=Team.PLAYER,
    from_position=(3, 4),
    to_position=(5, 6),
    movement_cost=2,
    remaining_movement=1
)
```
**Rationale**:
- Subscribers get all context needed for decisions
- Reduces need for additional data lookups
- Makes events self-contained and debuggable
- Supports rich logging and analytics

### 5. **Priority-Based Event Handling**
**Decision**: Events can be processed with priority ordering
**Implementation**:
```python
event_manager.subscribe(EventType.UNIT_MOVED, callback, priority=10)
event_manager.subscribe(EventType.UNIT_MOVED, callback, priority=5)
# Priority 10 callback runs first
```
**Rationale**:
- Critical systems (combat, safety checks) process first
- UI updates happen after game state changes
- Logging happens after all game logic
- Deterministic event processing order

### 6. **No Backward Compatibility**
**Decision**: "Breaking and fixing over making it compatible with previous and new systems"
**Approach**:
- Convert managers completely, not incrementally
- Remove old callback parameters entirely
- Force compilation errors until fixed properly
- No hybrid callback/event modes

**Rationale**:
- Clean architecture without legacy cruft
- Forces complete adoption of new patterns
- Prevents gradual degradation back to old patterns
- Simpler codebase without compatibility layers

### 7. **GameState as Single Source of Truth**
**Decision**: All persistent state lives in GameState; events coordinate behavior
**Pattern**:
```python
# State changes go through GameState
game_state.battle.current_turn += 1

# Coordination happens through events  
event_manager.publish(TurnStarted(turn=new_turn))
```
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation between state and behavior
- Events don't carry persistent state, just notifications
- GameState can be serialized/restored independently
- Event system is stateless and replayable

## Overview
This document tracks the migration from the legacy callback-based manager system to the new EventManager-based architecture. The goal is to eliminate ALL cross-dependencies between managers, with each manager only knowing about EventManager and GameState.

## Migration Priority Order

### Phase 1: Critical Path (High Priority)
1. **MoraleManager** - Core combat system component
2. **HazardManager** - Affects movement and combat
3. **EscalationManager** - Controls difficulty progression

### Phase 2: Game Flow (Medium Priority)
4. **AIController** - Enemy behavior system
5. **InterruptSystem** - Reaction system
6. **ObjectiveManager** - Victory conditions

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Low Priority)
7. Remove all legacy code
8. Update documentation
9. Performance optimization
10. Enhanced event debugging tools

## Success Criteria

The migration is complete when:
1. **Zero cross-dependencies** between managers
2. **All managers** use EventManager for communication
3. **No optional parameters** - EventManager is required everywhere
4. **All tests pass** with the new architecture
5. **No performance regression** from event overhead
6. **Documentation** fully updated

## Notes

- **Breaking Changes**: This migration intentionally breaks backward compatibility
- **No Hybrid Mode**: Managers should be fully converted, not partially
- **Event First**: When in doubt, use events over direct calls
- **Required Dependencies**: EventManager and GameState should never be optional
