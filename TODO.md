# List of TODOs


1. When exiting from Inspect mode, the cursor should be positioned in the current unit's position.
2. why do we use cast in places like actions.py?
3. This pattern where we create an action to publish an event seems cumbersome: `wait_action = Wait()`
4. Why handle_action_targeting() exists, if all it foes is self.execute_unit_action()?
