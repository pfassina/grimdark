# Grimdark SRPG Tileset Configuration
# Maps tile IDs to terrain types and gameplay properties
#
# This file serves as the single source of truth for:
# - Terrain gameplay properties (move cost, defense, etc.)
# - Terrain type mappings for game logic
#
# Visual properties (symbols, colors, sprites) are owned by individual renderers
